# My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my first web development project! This is a personal portfolio website built using pure **HTML** and **CSS**. This project marks the beginning of my journey into frontend development and serves as a digital resume to showcase my education, projects, and experiences.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This portfolio is a multi-page website designed to introduce who I am and what I've worked on. Since this is my first time exploring HTML and CSS, the focus was on understanding the core structure of web pages and basic styling principles.

### 📄 Pages Included:
- **Home (`index.html`)**: The landing page and introduction.
- **Education (`education.html`)**: Details about my academic background.
- **Experience (`experience.html`)**: A summary of my professional or extracurricular work.
- **Projects (`projects.html`)**: A showcase of the technical projects I've built.
- **Portfolio (`portfolio.html`)**: A curated gallery or secondary project overview.
- **Contact (`contact.html`)**: A section with my contact details for networking.
